# AI-constraint-satisfaction

The goal of this program was to take a list of courses along with requirements about when they can be taken (e.g. some are only offered in spring, some must be taken before others, some must be taken the last or penultimate semester) and create an AI that will come up with a schedule plan for graduation in no more that 7 semesters.  There were over fifty requirements (constraints that had to be satisfied)

See the report for how I solved it and the src folder for the actual code.
